## The value of APIs

APIs are the foundational plumbing of the pipelines:

| Gophers | Orchestrators |
|---|---|
| Retrieve data | Coordinate AI agents |
| Create new data | AI sidekick for MCP interactions (ex: MCP tools and resources) |
| Modify existing data | Manage tasks (queue, run, monitor) |
| Delete data | Initiate actions (ex: webhooks) |
| | Handle notifications |
